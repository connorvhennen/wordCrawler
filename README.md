# wordCrawler
Wordcrawler, an iterator class that acts like a char pointer but indexes words in std::string, is declared, defined, and used in the main function. The Wordcrawler class is designed to increment over objects of type string, but indexing by words. It works like a char pointer and does not create any copies of the Wordcrawler object type. There are variables for the string object stored, and for character charPointers used to increment by words in the string. There are overloaded operator functions for performing incrementation, subscripting, and dereferencing.
